The Department of Linguistics at the University of Georgia invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor with an anticipated start date of August 1, 2025. We seek a candidate with a documented record of research in computational linguistics that engages with theoretical and methodological questions relevant to general linguistics (e.g., in the areas of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics). Special consideration will be given to applicants whose work focuses on low resource languages and the application of natural language processing technology for the documentation and analysis of understudied languages. Teaching duties will include the development of new courses (in-person and/or online) in computational linguistics and natural language processing at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The teaching load is four courses per year. Candidates must have a Ph.D. in Linguistics or in a related discipline in hand at the time of appointment. This position affords the possibility of collaboration with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the School of Computing. The Department of Linguistics and the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences are committed to multidisciplinary research, collaboration, and academic innovation.
