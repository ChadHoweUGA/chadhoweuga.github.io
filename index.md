## üì¢ <span style="color:red">RECENT/UPCOMING</span> üì¢
- The most recent issue of the journal [Maya America](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/mayaamerica/) is now available! The issue, titled "Perspectives on Educations", features a number of interesting pieces. More specifically, "[e]ducation encompasses a breath of dimensions and issues, including the methods and goals of educational praxis, community and cooperative endeavors, health practices, multilingual rights, and environmental stewardship. Yet education can also be narrowly focused, designed to shape recipients into ways of thinking and acting that may conform to or benefit systems of dominance."
