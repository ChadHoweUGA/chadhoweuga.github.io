    "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that starting a new year requires trying to start new habits or, in this case, restarting an old habit. With any luck and a little more planning, this will become a more regular part of my routine. I don’t expect there to be too many ground-breaking insights in this blog, but perhaps I’ll find a few worthwhile inquiries to post that will attract a reader or two. If not, a writing excercise is helpful, I guess, even if no one’s reading.\nRegarding the pictures, I’ll typically use pictures I’ve taken myself, poorly framed though they may be. This one was taken in downtown Tucson, Arizona near the corner of S. Church Avenue and W. Broadway Blvd. Unbeknownst to me, there is quite a lot of public art in Tucson, with several buildings hosting large murals. This particular painting was done by Maxie Adler, “a Tucson-based artist whose work traces stories held in landscape and vanishing wild places, with an eye towards archiving the ephemeral or unseen.” Adler’s work is featured in several places around Tucson, including this utility box. This piece, and presumably the others, are a welcome way to break up the urban landscape in downtown Tucson. If you’re in Tucson, check out the many lovely contributions to public art; there are plenty to choose from.\n\n\n\n\nPublic art in Tucson, Arizona by Maxie Adler depicting a woodpecker."
