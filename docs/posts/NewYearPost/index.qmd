It is a truth universally acknowledged that starting a new year requires trying to start new habits or, in this case, restarting an old habit. With any luck and a little more planning, this will become a more regular part of my routine. I don't expect there to be too many ground-breaking insights in this blog, but perhaps I'll find a few worthwhile inquiries to post that will find a reader or two. If not, a writing excercise is helpful, I guess, even if no one's reading.
