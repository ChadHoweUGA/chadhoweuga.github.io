I serve as the Review Editor for the journal [Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/shll/shll-overview.xml?language=en&tab_body=editorialContent-75079). Reviews of academic books (e.g., monographs, edited volumes, handbooks, etc.) are generally solicited individually. If you would like for your book or volume to be considered for a review in SHLL, please have your commissioning editor arrange for a copy to be delivered to us. If you are working on a review, I strongly suggest reading the many excellent samples that have been published in previous volumes. There are also a number of useful guides and how-to's available that can help you as you put together your submission--such as [this article by Casey Brienza from Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/03/27/essay-writing-academic-book-reviews) and [this insightful resource prepared by Tala Khanmalek](https://ideasonfire.net/how-to-write-a-book-review/).
